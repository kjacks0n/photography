Hi, I'm Kate! <br> <br> By day, I'm a student at Algonquin College getting my Library and Information Technician Diploma. By night, I'm pursing my long-time love of photography and expanding my experiences and skills. I'm a born-and-raised Ottawa girl and truly appreciate the beauty found all over the city and so close in nearby areas. When I'm not working, you can probably find me reading, starting a new knitting/sewing project, or being a wannabe Dog Mom by borrowing other people's pets.

<h2> My Approach </h2> <!-- What to expect from me --!>
<p>
Ultimately I strive for real moments frozen in time, whether it's a quick glance, a flash of a grin, or an honest laugh, I live for the details and the subtleties. I do my best to capture these small moments through documentary-style photography, meaning I direct as little as possible and just let you act as you normally would, forgetting the camera is even there which lets me shoot you in your best light. That being said, I understand how awkward people can feel knowing their photo is being taken, so I do my best to make everyone as relaxed as possible. I will lead you through different poses and prompts that allow for natural movement and interactions so your portraits won't look or feel stiff. <br> <br>
I believe a collaborative approach is essential to getting what you want out of your photo session. Tell me about your vision, your style, your questions or concerns, and your limitations and we'll work together to make something beautiful that you are equally comfortable and proud of. <br> <br>
My work is currently free of charge as I continue to learn and develop myself as a photographer. You will recieve a digital gallery of edited images 2-4 weeks after the session you can download and share or print as you like!
